    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I am an avid tchoukball player and am proud to say that I have represented my country in several international tournaments including the World Tchoukball Championships (2019 & 2023), European Tchoukball Championships (2022).</p>
    <p>At the most recent world championships the UK men's squad came 5th in the world, and at the European championships we came 3rd.</p>
    <p>Domestically, I play for the Bury St Edmund's Kings squad who are current league champions with an impressive current run as back-to-back UK champions.</p>
    <p>I play as a Right Shooter and am constantly looking for way to improve my game!</p>
    <p>For more information, please see my player bio on: <a href="https://www.tchoukball.org.uk/player/jack-leitch/" target="_blank">https://www.tchoukball.org.uk/player/jack-leitch/</a></p>
